# 1 - The output is written

 a. "x is 2"
 b. "" - no output
 c. "x is 1"
 d. "z is 7"

# 2 - The value after the switch statement are given

 a. y = 1
 b. y = 1

# 3

The code outputs:
2
4
6
8
10

We run through the loop body 10 times

# 4

The answer to this question depends on the value of i entering the loop.
If i <= 10, nothing will be outputted, and we will run through the loop body 0 times.
If i > 10, then we will print all of the even numbers greater than i, and the loop will run an infinite amount of times.
